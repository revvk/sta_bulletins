      Jesus said, "The first commandment is this: Hear, O Israel:
      The Lord our God is the only Lord. Love the Lord your
      God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your
      mind, and with all your strength. The second is this: Love

  - reference: "1 John 1:8,9"
    text: >-
      If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the

      faithful and just, will forgive our sins and cleanse us from all
      unrighteousness.

  - reference: "Hebrews 4:14, 16"
    text: >-
      Since we have a great high priest who has passed through the
      heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us with confidence draw
      near to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and
      find grace to help in time of need.
