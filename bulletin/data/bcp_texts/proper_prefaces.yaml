advent:
  text: >-
    Because you sent your beloved Son to redeem us from sin and
    death, and to make us heirs in him of everlasting life; that
    when he shall come again in power and great triumph to
    judge the world, we may without shame or fear rejoice to
    behold his appearing.

incarnation:
  note: "Used for Christmas season"
  text: >-
    Because you gave Jesus Christ, your only Son, to be born for
    us; who, by the mighty power of the Holy Spirit, was made
    perfect Man of the flesh of the Virgin Mary his mother; so
    that we might be delivered from the bondage of sin, and
    receive power to become your children.

epiphany:

    knowledge of your glory in the face of your Son Jesus Christ
    our Lord.

    label: "Lent (temptation and triumph)"
    text: >-
      Through Jesus Christ our Lord, who was tempted in every

      alone, but for him who died for us and rose again.

      they may come to the fullness of grace which you have
      prepared for those who love you.

holy_week:

    Through Jesus Christ our Lord. For our sins he was lifted

    source of eternal salvation for all who put their trust in him.

easter:
  text: >-
    But chiefly are we bound to praise you for the glorious
    resurrection of your Son Jesus Christ our Lord; for he is the
    true Paschal Lamb, who was sacrificed for us, and has taken
    away the sin of the world. By his death he has destroyed
    death, and by his rising to life again he has won for us
    everlasting life.

ascension:
  text: >-
    Through your dearly beloved Son Jesus Christ our Lord.
    After his glorious resurrection he openly appeared to his
    disciples, and in their sight ascended into heaven, to prepare
    a place for us; that where he is, there we might also be, and
    reign with him in glory.

pentecost:
  text: >-
    Through Jesus Christ our Lord. In fulfillment of his true
    promise, the Holy Spirit came down from heaven, lighting

    truth; uniting peoples of many tongues in the confession of
    one faith, and giving to your Church the power to serve you
    as a royal priesthood, and to preach the Gospel to all nations.

    and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.

dedication_of_a_church:

    prepared for us a dwelling place eternal in the heavens.
