prayer_a:
  post_sanctus: >-
    Holy and gracious Father: In your infinite love you made us for yourself;
    and, when we had fallen into sin and become subject to evil and death,
    you, in your mercy, sent Jesus Christ, your only and eternal Son,
    to share our human nature, to live and die as one of us, to reconcile us
    to you, the God and Father of all.

    forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the
    remembrance of me."

# --- Prayer B (BCP pp. 367-369) ---
prayer_b:
  post_sanctus: >-
    We give thanks to you, O God, for the goodness and love which you have
    made known to us in creation; in the calling of Israel to be your people;
    in your Word spoken through the prophets; and above all in the Word made
    flesh, Jesus, your Son. For in these last days you sent him to be incarnate
    from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world.
    In him, you have delivered us from evil, and made us worthy to stand
    before you. In him, you have brought us out of error into truth,
    out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life.

  institution_bread: >-
    On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread;
    and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his
    disciples, and said, "Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you.
    Do this for the remembrance of me."

  institution_cup: >-
    After supper he took the cup of wine; and when he had given thanks,
    he gave it to them, and said, "Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood
    of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness
    of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me."

  memorial_intro: "Therefore, according to his command, O Father,"

  memorial_acclamation:
    - "We remember his death,"
    - "We proclaim his resurrection,"
    - "We await his coming in glory;"

  epiclesis: >-
    And we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all;
    presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine.

  epiclesis_2: >-
    We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that
    they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the
    new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be
    acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. In the fullness
    of time, put all things in subjection under your Christ, and bring us to
    that heavenly country where, with Saint Andrew and all your saints, we may
    enter the everlasting heritage of your sons and daughters; through Jesus
    Christ our Lord, the firstborn of all creation, the head of the Church,
    and the author of our salvation.

  doxology: >-
    By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit
    all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and for ever.

  doxology_response: "AMEN."
